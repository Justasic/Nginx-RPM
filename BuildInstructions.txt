The configuration can be built with the following commands:

$ git clone git://github.com/Justasic/Nginx-RPM.git ~/rpmbuild/
$ cd ~/rpmbuild/
$ python build.py

Once all is built with no errors, there will be a *.src.rpm which contains all these sources in ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/ and the actual binary RPMs in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/$arch/

Where $arch is the architecture you have built the packages on.
