# I built this script because spectool is an epic failure and so is rpmbuild.
# GitHub downloads things via Content-Disposition which means that the download
# file differs from the one given in the url.
# This makes rpmbuild freak the fuck out because it cant find the file. This could
# be easy to solve if I could simply tell rpmbuild "Download from this URL but the file
# is actually gonna be named this".
#
# In any case, this script will download the needed files for nginx and then run rpmbuild.
# It will also check for the fedora-packager and various libs needed to build nginx with
# pagespeed. This will drastically easy the compile of nginx.
